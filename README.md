As a start this is task one on electronics and eleictric power path 
The task has 2 requirements
1) Open two LED using arduino
2) Open a LED Matrix using arduino
   


to open two LED using arduino we need : Arduino uno , LED , bread board , wires , resistors
LED has to terminals anode and cathode the anode is the positive part so we attach the resistors to the anode 
and then write the code on the arduino to make the led on the other led off in period of time



to open a LED Matrix using arduino we need : Arduino uno , 64 LEDs , bread board , wires
at first we organize the 64 LEDs to take shape of a matrix , then we attach all the anodes together ,same thing for the cathodes
then we attach to the arduino ports
